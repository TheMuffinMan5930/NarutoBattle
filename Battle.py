Tom vs Bob
bob goes first (need to check for speed)
bob runs at tom (need to make arena, speed determins how much one can move in one turn)
bob braces himself (need to write this) (does the advantage last one check? or until they do something besides bracing)
bob creates two shadow clones of himself (gives him disadvantage)
!!!IMPORTANT you can only do the extra turn thing in a scenario where you will eventually be checked, say, an attack!!!
(all shadow clones have seperate turns)
(in this case it is assumed that the shadowclone was thnge first move of all shadowcloens, meaning once they attack, they all have disadvantage when they attack)
bob's first sh clone punches, and misses (does the advantage go away? or stay)
the second clone hits tom and tom is launched back (how does the propulsion work?) (this sh clone also gets another turn, but he does nothing)
bob himself runs at tom and hits him with a 100meter punch, launching him backwards and into a tree behind him, dealing severe damage bob disapates his shadow clones with his turn (casue he landed a hit on tom)
